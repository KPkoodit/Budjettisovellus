## Technologies used:
* **Java**: The programming language used for the project.
* **JavaFX**: A set of libraries which allow the creation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a desktop app.
* **Maven**: A build automation tool which manages dependencies and builds the app.
* **MariaDB**: A database used for storing the information.
* **Jakarta Persistence (JPA)**: A library which provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java.
* **Hibernate**: A framework that simplifies the communication between a program and a database.
* **JUnit 4**: A framework used for unit testing.
* **Mockito**: A mocking framework used for testing.

## Installation and configuration

Installing MariaDB before running the application is necessary.
After installing, you need to create a new database for the expenses with the following credentials:
* Database Name: budjettisovellus
* Username: your_username
* Password: your_password

Update the persistence.xml file located in the META-INF folder with your database credentials:
* property: javax.persistence.jdbc.user -> your_username
* property: javax.persistence.jdbc.password -> your_password

After this, the application can be run using Eclipse or other IDE. Class MainView contains the main class of the newest version of the application, so this is the class you should run. Class Main contains the old graphic user interface.

Alternatively the application can be run through command line. To run the application through command line, ensure that Maven is installed and added to system's PATH environment variable. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the root directory of the application. Then type the following commands (before running the third command, change the module path of the command to match a real javafx module path of your device):
*	mvn compile
*	mvn package
* java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar target/projekti-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
